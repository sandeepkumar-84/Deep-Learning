Deep learning concepts and projects


1. Colab versions of the projects implementing ANN or multilayer perceptrons for different data (binary, multi-class, regression data) 
   Churn prediction = binary or logistic problem
   Admission prediction = linear or regression problem 
   mnist image prediction - multiclass problem
