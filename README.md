# Deep-Learning
Deep learning concepts and projects


1. Colab versions of the projects implementing ANN or multilayer perceptrons for different data (binary, multi-class, regression data) 
   Churn prediction = binary or logistic problem
   Admission prediction = linear or regression problem 
   mnist image prediction - multiclass problem
   Resolving the overfitting issues
    1. Dropout layers - regression and logistic examples
    2. Regularization - example
    3. Weight initialization  - example
         he normal for relu
         xavier for sigmoid or tanh
