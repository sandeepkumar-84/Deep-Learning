# Deep-Learning
Deep learning concepts and projects


1. Colab versions of the projects implementing ANN or multilayer perceptrons for different data (binary, multi-class, regression data) 
   Churn prediction = binary or logistic problem
   Admission prediction = linear or regression problem 
   mnist image prediction - multiclass problem
   Resolving the overfitting issues
    1. Dropout layers - regression and logistic examples
    2. Regularization - example
    3. Weight initialization  - example
         he normal for relu
         xavier for sigmoid or tanh 
   4. Batch Regularization - notebook example
   5. Optimizers - no seperate file is added
   6. Adding Keras tuner nobook - very important- It guides how to user the tunner to get best hyperparameter values.  
   7. Added Encoding text into integers using sample data and IMDB ds 
   8.LSTM-Next word predictor
